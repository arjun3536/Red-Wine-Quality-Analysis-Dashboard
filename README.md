# 🍷 Red Wine Quality Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **red wine quality** using the famous **Wine Quality Dataset**.  
The dashboard is built in **Power BI** to explore how different chemical properties such as **alcohol, pH, sulphates, and fixed acidity** influence wine quality ratings.

## 📊 Features of the Dashboard
- **KPIs**: Average Alcohol, Average pH, Average Quality, Fixed Acidity.  
- **Line Chart**: Trend of average alcohol by quality levels.  
- **Bar Chart**: Distribution of alcohol across different wine quality scores.  
- **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between alcohol and sulphates, colored by quality.  
- **Card Visuals**: Highlight important statistics at a glance.  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset comes from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository - Wine Quality Dataset**.  
It contains physicochemical tests of red wine with quality ratings (0–10 scale).  


## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop** for dashboard creation  
- **DAX** for calculated measures (Average Alcohol, Avg pH, etc.)  
- **Excel/CSV** for dataset handling  

## 🚀 Insights
- Higher quality wines tend to have **higher alcohol levels**.  
- Wines with balanced **pH** and moderate **sulphates** achieve better ratings.  
- **Alcohol & sulphates together** strongly influence wine quality.
